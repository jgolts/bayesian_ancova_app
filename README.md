This is an R Shiny app that performs Bayesian ANCOVA on pre/post measurement datasets. It was created originally as part of my research project on Bayesian ANCOVA for pre/post data, code for which can be found in [my bancova_analysis repo](https://github.com/jgolts/bancova_analysis). Please feel free to fork it and modify to your liking. It is hosted at https://jgolts.shinyapps.io/bayesian_ancova_app/.
